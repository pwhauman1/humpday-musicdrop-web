                    What's up, I'm Peter. I'm a software engineer who really likes music üòÅ and loves
                    sharing it. Every hump day, get a new album to listen to (picked by me!). Some
                    are personal favorites, some are new things I'm listening to, some are just
                    albums that deserve a little more attention. Interested? Sign up!
